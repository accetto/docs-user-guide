# Requirements
{: .fs-9 }

for using *accetto images*
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
There are no special requirements for using *accetto images* except a working environment that supports [Docker][docker] images.

For [headless working][this-headless-working] you only need a common web browser.

Optionally you can also use one of many freely available VNC viewers.

The only *recommended adjustment* is to increase the [shared memory][this-shared-memory] size in the containers.

# Version sticker
{: .fs-9 }

feature explained
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
The *version sticker feature* is unique to *accetto image family*.
It has been invented by *accetto* as part of [*accetto open source projects*][accetto-github].

{: .definition}
> *Version sticker* is a description of a feature set of a particular Docker image build.
> It is somehow looser concept than the usual *version number* used in programming.
> However, it is tight enough to be conceptually used as a *kind of fingerprint* of a particular Docker image build.

There are two forms of *version stickers*:

- A `verbose version sticker` is essentially a list of the *feature variables* and the *versions of the essential software* contained in the image.
What is *essential* can be freely decided by the developer of the image.

  The intended usage of the *verbose version stickers* is to compare image builds.
  If the *verbose version stickers* match, then the images are considered to be the same in the meaning, that no re-building is required.

- A `short version sticker` is a compact string describing the *versions of important software* included in the image.
What is *important* can be freely decided by the developer of the image.

  The intended usage of the *short verbose sticker* is for the image metadata (labels) and for the badges, that are usually included in the readme files.

## Version sticker usage

The *version stickers* serve multiple purposes and they are important by building and maintaining *accetto images*.

However, for image users they play only an informative role.

The *short version sticker* value describes the version of a particular Docker image and it is persisted in its *label* during the build-time.
It is also shown as its *version sticker badge* in the image README file.

The *verbose version sticker* value can be revealed by clicking on the *version sticker badge* in the image README file on the Docker Hub.

The *version sticker* values are generated by the script `$STARTUPDIR/version_sticker.sh`.

The script will show a short help if it's executed with the `-h` argument.

```shell
$STARTUPDIR/version_sticker.sh -h
```

{% include components/callout-terminal.md %}
> <pre>
> Usage: version_sticker [-h] [-v] [-V] [-f]
> -h    help
> -v    short version sticker
> -V    verbose version sticker
> -f    features
> </pre>

There is also a convenient `Version Sticker` launcher on the container desktop.
